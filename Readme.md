## Personal Access Token
To start using [Figma Inspector](#Figma-Inspector), a Figma Personal Access Token is needed for API calls.
> [!WARNING]
> The token is stored in raw format.

1. Visit the [Figma API Authentication Page](https://www.figma.com/developers/api?fuid=797042793200923967#authentication).
2. Click + Get personal access token to generate the token.
3. Copy the generated token.
4. Locate the Figma script in [Unity's Inspector](#Figma-Inspector).
5. Paste the token into the designated field.

# Quick Start
- Finish [Installing](#Installing)
- Open `~Samples` folder
- Open `Test.unity`
- Go to `Figma` GameObject
- In the `Title`, enter the title of your Figma document (ie dfeQabSU71CHXVqweameSF) from Figma website ([some templates](https://www.figma.com/community/files))
- Go to `Test.cs` and edit the UXML attribute to points to your Page/Element path
- Configure [Personal Access Token](#Personal-Access-Token) in [Unity's Inspector](#Figma-Inspector)
- Click `Update UI & Images`
- Save the `VisualAssetTree` somewhere
- Start `playmode` and enjoy!

# Usage
Working with this plugin is done through using Figma component inspector FigmaInspector. 
In addition, components derived from the Element class should be created and added to the same GameObject hierarchy.
These components serve a dual purpose:

1. During the import phase, they assist in filtering and configuring various aspects of the document, such as frame selection and image handling.
2. During runtime, they provide the functionality to manipulate UXML and USS data structures.

| Property                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Panel Settings**                 | A crucial asset enabling Unity to render UXML-based user interfaces within the Game View.                                                                                                              |
| **Source Asset**                   | The UXML asset responsible for outlining the structural framework of the user interface.                                                                                                               |
| **Sort Order**                     | Specifies the rendering sequence of UXML assets when multiple Panel Settings instances exist within a project.                                                                                         |
| **Title**                          | Designates the title from the Figma document URL for identification purposes.                                                                                                                          |
| **Asset**                          | Represents the UXML asset correlating with the corresponding asset within the UI document script. (Refer to the section above for further details)                                                     |
| **Update Buttons**                 | Facilitates UI updates, offering options to include or exclude the downloading of all associated images.                                                                                               |
| **De-root and Re-order Hierarchy** | Adjusts the organization of all frames based on each element's RootOrder property, optimizing the UI hierarchy.                                                                                        |
| **Filter by Path**                 | When activated, this feature limits the download to only those UI frames that have associated scripts attached to the prefab, otherwise, all UI elements within the Figma document will be downloaded. |
| **Additional Fonts Directories**   | Provides the capability to specify paths to any fonts that are incorporated within the UI, ensuring seamless visual consistency.                                                                       |

## Folders Layout
This is how the final setup should look:
```
<UI folder>
  ├── UI.uxml
  ├── UI.uss
  ├── CachedAssets_UI.json
  ├── Elements
  │   ├── CustomElement.uxml
  │   └── CustomElement.uss
  ├── Components
  │   ├── Component.uxml  
  │   └── Component.uss  
  ├── Frames
  │   └── Canvas1  
  │       ├── Frame1.uxml  
  │       ├── Frame1.uss
  │       ├── Frame2.uxml  
  │       └── Frame2.uss
  ├── Images
  │   ├── AmazingImage.svg
  │   └── PerfectImage.png
  └── Fonts
      └── Inter-Regular.ttf
```
Please note that you need to place your **custom fonts** in a **'Fonts' folder**. If you try to import a Figma document that includes a font which does not exist in the 'Fonts' folder, you will see a message in the console indicating which font is missing. You can also add an additional fonts directory using the appropriate property in the Figma object.

## Figma class
During the update process the Figma class retrieves data based on the Uxml and Query attributes of the Element scripts. It then utilizes this data while producing UXML asset.
> [!WARNING]
> Element scripts should be attached to the same game object to which the Figma script is also attached.

## Element class (OnInitialize, OnRebuild, Custom Elements)
The Uxml and Query attributes define the structure of the Uxml asset and, consequently, the appearance of your UI.
The type of the field following the Query attribute defines the UI element itself and, consequently, its behavior (VisualElement, Button, Label, etc.). Field types are written into UXML. Therefore, if you change the field type (for example, from VisualElement to Button), you will need to perform a Figma Update to regenerate the UXML.
Each element can override OnInitialize and OnRebuild methods which can be used to do any initial setup operations.

``` csharp
[Uxml("TestPage/TestFrame", UxmlDownloadImages.Everything, UxmlElementTypeIdentification.ByElementType)]
[AddComponentMenu("Figma/Samples/Test")]
public class Test : Element
{
	const int minCircles = 1;
	const int maxCircles = 7;

	#region Fields
	[Query("Header")] Label header;

	[Query("CloneButton", Clicked = nameof(Clone))] Button cloneButton;
	[Query("RemoveButton", Clicked = nameof(Remove))] Button removeButton;
	[Query("CloneContainer", StartRoot = true)] VisualElement cloneContainer;
	[Query("CloneCircle", EndRoot = true)] PerfectCircle cloneCircle;

	[Query("SyncButton", Clicked = nameof(Sync))] Button syncButton;
	[Query("SyncContainer")] VisualElement syncContainer;
	[Query("SyncContainer/SyncCircle")] PerfectCircle syncCircle;

	[Query("FunctionDescription", Hide = true)] Label functionDescription;
	#endregion

	#region Methods
	protected override void OnInitialize() => cloneContainer.style.flexWrap = Wrap.NoWrap;
	protected override void OnRebuild() => header.text = "Welcome to Figma Test Frame!";

	void Clone()
	{
		if (cloneContainer.childCount == maxCircles) return;

		cloneCircle.Clone(cloneContainer);
	}
	void Remove()
	{
		if (cloneContainer.childCount == minCircles) return;

		cloneContainer.Remove(cloneContainer.Children().First());
	}
	void Sync()
	{
		void RandomColor(int index) => syncContainer.Children().ElementAt(index).style.backgroundColor = Random.ColorHSV();

		syncCircle.Sync(syncContainer, RandomColor, Enumerable.Range(0, Random.Range(1, maxCircles + 1)));
		syncCircle.Hide();

		functionDescription.Show();
	}
	#endregion
}
```
### Custom element example
``` csharp
public class PerfectCircle : SyncButtonSimple<int>
{
	public new class UxmlFactory : UxmlFactory<PerfectCircle> { }

	#region Methods
	public override bool IsVisible(int index, int data) => true;
	#endregion
}
```

## ISubElement
This interface serves as an identifier, signifying that within the IRootElement hierarchy, an element exists which can function as a component based on the VisualElement class.

## IRootElement
This interface acts as a marker, indicating that an element within the IRootElement hierarchy is capable of functioning as a component derived from the VisualElement class.

## Visual Element Style
The imported USS file contains all the classes used by Visual Elements. USS is inspired by CSS and has a similar syntax. To manipulate properties in your code, you should use the techniques described below.
### Changing Element Appearance
To change the appearance of a VisualElement, you should manipulate its style properties. For example, to set the top margin of an element to 3:
```csharp
element.style.marginTop = 3;
```
### Reading Element Style Data
If you need to read style data from a VisualElement, you should use its resolved style properties. For example, to retrieve the value of the top margin:
```csharp
float margin = element.resolvedStyle.marginTop;
```
> You can find the list of all supported properties in the official Unity documentation.

## Visual Element Extensions
When working with VisualElements, there are various visual element extensions that allow you to find/clone/replace/etc elements:
```csharp
VisualElement rectangle = element.Find<VisualElement>("Rectangle");
```
```csharp
VisualElement elementClone = options.Clone();
```
```csharp
element.Replace(newElement);
```

| **Vector Constraints**       | Vectors should be visible, should not contain Image Fills, and, where possible, should be grouped into Unions.                          |
| **Fill Limitations**         | Each UI element can contain only a single Fill attribute.                                                                               |
| **Auto-Layout Restrictions** | Stroke borders are not supported within Auto-Layout configurations.                                                                     |
| **Alignment Constraints**    | Horizontal and vertical centering cannot be mixed within the same parent element; doing so will default the alignment to center-center. |
| **Circle Representation**    | For optimal visual rendering, circles should be implemented using rectangles rather than ellipses.                                      |
